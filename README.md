This repository will include any materials regarding exams for the class:

For exam 1: 
* The exam will be Sept. 21 from 9:30 to 10:50 am.  
* As a reminder, I will be out of town and hence a proctor will be administrating the exam. 
* The exam will be closed book/notes/computer. It will cover all the topics in the course up to the end of class on Tuesday, Sept 19. 
* The included file 'exam1_topics.pdf' give some indication
of the type of questions that may be asked.


Exams 2 and 3 will closely mimic a common interview technique for data science jobs in which a challenge is issued and you have a short period of time to produce a solution.  Second, it will free up class periods for more content (yay!).

The format for Exams 2 and 3:

* You will sign up for a date/time you want to exam released to you.  
* You will have 24 hours from tha.t moment to produce the requested solution using whatever resources you wish EXCEPT FOR other any students at SM U or any faculty but me.  As well, do not look at an exam released to a fellow student.  Wait until your exam goets released to you.  
* The exam window for Exam 2th Exams 2 and 3 will be "take home" exams. The reason for this  will be Oct. 26 to Oct. 29th. Fill out the following poll by noon on Sept. 24th for when you want your exam to be released to you (it will be via canvas.  Only the given days/times are available).  If you do not fill out the poll by the requested day/time, I will assign you one.
