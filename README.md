This repository will include any materials regarding exams for the class:

For exam 1: 
* The exam will be Feb. 22 from 3:30 to 4:50 pm.  
* The exam will be closed book/notes/computer. It will cover all the topics in the course up to the end of class on Tuesday, Feb. 20. 
* The included file 'exam1_topics.pdf' give some indication
of the type of questions that may be asked.


Exams 2 and 3 will closely mimic a common interview technique for data science jobs in which a challenge is issued and you have a short period of time to produce a solution. First, this will help you prepare for interviews.  Second, it will free up class periods for more content (yay!).

The format for Exams 2 and 3 will be ``take home'':

* You will sign up for a date/time you want the exam released to you.  
* You will have 24 hours from that moment to produce the requested solution using whatever resources you wish EXCEPT FOR any other students at SMU or any faculty but me.  As well, do not look at an exam released to a fellow student.  Wait until your exam gets released to you.  
* The exam window for Exam 2 and 3 will be announced later.


Final Exam (May 10th at 3 pm in the usual classroom):
The final exam will have a format similar to the first exam.
