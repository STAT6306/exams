|         Take home exam 2: Analyzing Airline Flight Delays     | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For this exam, you can use whatever software you prefer.  However, this exam has been written
to be addressed with the split-apply-combine philosophy in general and dplyr in particular (Pandas
is the standard analogue in Python, though Pandas has been written to mimic R’s framework).

For this exam, we will be analyzing airline flight delays.  The first step in the exam will be downloading the
flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics:

https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time

See the code “getFlightData.R” for instructions on how to download and convert the data to an R object.

The basic functions behind dplyr are in “coreCommandsStudents.R” (Note that 
data looked at in that code is NOT the same data as for the exam).
