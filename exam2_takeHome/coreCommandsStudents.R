# Some dplyr notes:
#   - the main resource: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v040i01
#   - Key functions:
#       -Pick observations by their values: filter()
#       -Reorder the rows: arrange()
#       -Pick variables by their names: select()
#       -Create new variables with functions of existing variables: mutate()
#       -Collapse many values down to a single summary: summarise()
#   - All can be used in conjunction with group_by()
#   - All functions, "verbs", work similarly:
#       -The first argument is a data frame -> allows for "pipe" functionality
#       -The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. 
#        You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using $.
#       -The result is a new data frame.

#filter
#       -Pick observations by their values (that is, rows)
